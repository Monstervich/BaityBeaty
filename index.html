			<h2>MISSION</h2>
			<p>The UAE is signatory of the COP21 agreement (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en">http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en</a>) and fully committed to contributing towards the world’s sustainable future.</p>
			<p>Team baity be’aty, based in Dubai is seeking to play a small but important role in that future by taking part in the Solar Decathlon Middle East 2018 Competition. Our participation is in line with the University’s values that are outward looking and shaping the future. We seek to leverage the expertise of faculty, the enthusiasm of the students eager to see what they have learned in theory put into practice and collaborating with industry partners to bring the project to a successful conclusion. During the execution of the project, and armed with relevant knowledge, students will be asked to challenge existing norms and encouraged to explore innovative ideas.</p>
			<p>Baity, my home, will exist in harmony with be’aty, my environment, demonstrating that sustainable, comfortable and affordable living is within reach in Dubai. This large-scale interdisciplinary project will provide an excellent learning opportunity for students involved. By addressing real-world problems, they will gather the expertise and experience essential to contribute to the drive towards sustainability in this region and beyond.</p>
			<br>
			<h2><span>THE</span>TEAM, <span>THE</span>GOALS</h2>
			<p>The team is composed of an inter-disciplinary mix of students and faculty, with knowledge and expertise to address problems and their innovative solutions from various perspectives. The aim is to design and build a sustainable, affordable home for the future, located in a hot, arid region. It will combine innovative design features, engineering systems and technology, leveraging existing and emerging technologies that can monitor and control optimal usage of resources. A flexible living space expands outdoors in the cooler winter months and offers pleasant indoors living in the hotter summer months by integrating vegetation into its spatial design.</p>

			<h2><span>SOLAR</span>DECATHLON</h2>
			<p>The Solar Decathlon is an international competition created by the U.S. Department of Energy in which universities from all over the world meet to design, build and operate a grid-connected, solar powered house. (<a target="_blank" href="http://solardecathlonme.com/solar-decathlon.html">Source: Solar Decathlon Middle East</a>)</p>
			<p>The houses use solar energy as the only energy source and are equipped with all the technologies that permit maximum energy efficiency. During the final phase of the competition teams assemble their houses in a main expo area, open to the general public, while undergoing the 10 contests of the competition, reason for which this event is called Decathlon. (‘Deca’ derives from Greek and means ten)</p>
			<p>The first Solar Decathlon was held in 2002 and previous additions have been organized in different areas including the U.S, Europe and China.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-tree"></i><span>HERITAGE</span>AND<span>GROWTH</span></h2>
				<p>Founded in Edinburgh in 1935 and situated in the heart of Edinburgh, we have built our UK reputation and extended our global reach dramatically. Our growth in Scotland saw our Glasgow office opening in 1977, with the UK expansion continuing throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, opening our Manchester office in 1997 and our London office in 2001. Along with our continuing UK growth, our clients and European links gave us an opportunity to open an office in Kiev, Ukraine in 1996.</p>
                <p>Our expansion into the Middle East started when we took the decision to capitalise on identified opportunities in the UAE by opening our Abu Dhabi office in 2009 and our Dubai office in 2014 and we are now firmly established in two of the Middle East’s most important hubs.</p>
                <p>Looking to the USA, having successfully supported Oregon based consultancy, PlanB since 2009, we launched our joint venture known as PlanB Consultancy International LLC in 2012, providing the full range of services offered by T&amp;A and PlanB to an ever growing client base from offices in Portland, Seattle and Hawaii.</p>
                <p>Our reputation for professionalism and service quality through delivery continues to grow as we forge relationships with existing and new clients alike.</p>
